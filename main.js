Heâ€™s cheerful, sociable, and knows how to keep things balanced, especially when he's setting his traps with tactical precision. Libras love harmony, and while Teemoâ€™s shrooms might not seem harmonious to his enemies, his strategic approach and balanced gameplay make him an ideal representative of the sign." },
    { name: "Yasuo", image: "Graphics/yasuo.png", Sound: "Sounds/Yasuo_Select.mp3", description: "Yasuo is all about diving headfirst into danger, which makes him a perfect match for bold and fearless Aries. Heâ€™s got that classic ram-like energy, charging in, never backing down, and always pushing forward.
